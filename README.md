**Abstract:** Handwritten Signature is a widely used biometric in daily life as a mean of identity verification of an individual. For offline signature verification both accuracy and speed are important parameters. Accuracy may vary as the samples from signature datasets show a high intra-class variability. As these properties depend on the feature descriptor taken to represent the signature image, this selection is very important. In this study we provide a comparative performance evaluation of wellknown histogram based descriptors like SIFT and SURF and a wide variety of binary descriptors like BRIEF, ORB, BRISK and FREAK in the application of handwritten signature verification. We compare the performance of these feature descriptors against speed and accuracy. After the experimental analysis we have observed that binary features like ORB is faster with moderate accuracy but SIFT-like descriptors give better accuracy. Among them the combination of FAST feature detection and BRIEF descriptor is the fastest one but with lowest accuracy.
